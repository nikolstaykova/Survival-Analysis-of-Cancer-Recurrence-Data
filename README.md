This repository contains a time-to-event survival analysis project investigating cancer recurrence in patients undergoing hormone therapy. Using a dataset of 9,024 patients with 2,064 recorded recurrences, the study explores whether hormone therapy is associated with differences in recurrence risk.
Key analyses included:
Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis – Survival curves are generated for patients on and not on hormone therapy, with statistical comparisons between groups. The assumptions of the tests are discussed, and the calculation of test statistics for assessing significance is explained.
Incidence Rate Ratio – The association between hormone therapy and recurrence is quantified, with interpretation of the results.
Cox Proportional Hazards Model – A univariate Cox model evaluates hormone therapy as a risk factor. Proportional hazards assumptions are tested both graphically and statistically, with results presented and interpreted.
This repository demonstrates the application of survival analysis methods to real-world clinical data and provides code for reproducible research.
